### About Me
I am currently a Research Scientist at [ByteDance Research](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), specializing in the AI Drug Discovery team under the leadership of [Prof. Quanquan Gu](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/). My research interests encompass <u>generative models</u>, <u>computer vision</u>, and <u>cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)</u>.

Prior to my current role, I worked with [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/)'s Education Team, focusing on business algorithms. Before that, I served as a Computer Vision Researcher in [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en)'s Medical Team. I earned my Master’s degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019, where I concentrated on image saliency detection.
